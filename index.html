        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>An increase in arable land comes at the cost of green cover. Rural pockets are fast losing native trees and
            local fauna in India. The story is no different in Punjab. Currently, Punjab’s green cover is down to 3.67%
            of total land, whereas the country's average is 21.71%. Now is the time to act.

            Plant for Punjab is RoundGlass Foundation’s initiative that promotes responsible environmental practices,
            cares for biodiversity, reduces carbon footprint, and offers protection against future ecological
            degradation. Through the initiative, we aim to plant 1 billion trees in Punjab to rebuild the natural
            ecosystem, increase green cover, and improve water table levels. </p>
